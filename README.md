# muWeather
## muWeather project app

### muWeather is a weather app written using Java Swing UI for its frontend and Python for its backend. It uses openweathermap.org's api to retrieve weather data information.

### Retrieved data:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Wind Speed
- Wind Direction
- Weather Description

### Usage:

Simply enter a city name such as "Istanbul". If such a city is found, the information for the city will be displayed. 
If no such city is found, City Not Found error will be shown on the screen.

### Execution:

#### Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Java Runtime (Preferably 18)
- A Network Connection
------------------------------------
- Windows 7+ (haven't tested but probably will break on vista)
- MacOS: No idea, anything modern should work.
- Linux: Go figure out yourself 
-------------------------------------

#### Steps:

- Make sure that all the files are in the same directory (IMPORTANT!!!)
- Compile Entry.java and run it 
```bash
  javac Entry.java
  java Entry```
  
 - An executable version will probably never come due to language constraints.
